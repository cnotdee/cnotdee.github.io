				<p>I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology at Central Luzon State University. Before enrolling at BSIT, I had aspired to be a web designer, manual tester, QA and graphic designer since junior high. With the experience learned from pursuing an IT specialization in my senior year of high school. It boosted my confidence to continue on the path I'd started back then. Also, I joined one of CLSU's organizations, the Microsoft Computer Society (MSCS). <br><br>

				Since starting this career, it's been a roller coaster ride for me because I've experienced failures and complicated situations while doing and learning the various programming languages.<br><br>

				I've spent a lot of time working and studying on it to lay the groundwork for my future. Hence, I'm searching for my next challenge and developing new initiatives to help me succeed in the information technology field.</p>
